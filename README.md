BirdCam Project
---------------

Images taken from a Raspberry Pi and uploaded to an Azure IotHub, this then copies them to blob storage. 
The incoming images are then processed by the Azure Function Image Analyser code in this project which is sent to Azure Cognitive Services to identify what is in the picture.
